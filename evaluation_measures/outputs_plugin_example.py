#
# Kuaa is a framework for the automation of machine learning experiments.
#
# It provides a workflow-based standardized environment for easy evaluation of
# feature descriptors, normalization techniques, classifiers and fusion
# approaches.
#
# Techniques of each kind can be easily plugged into the framework as they can
# be implemented as plugins, with standardized inputs and outputs.
# The framework also provides a recommendation module in order to help
# inexperienced researchers in choosing adequate or alternative techniques for
# experiments.

# This framework was developed during the research collaboration of Institute
# of Computing (University of Campinas, Brazil) and Samsung Eletrônica da
# Amazônia Ltda. entitled "Pattern recognition and classification by feature
# engineering, *-fusion, open-set recognition, and meta-recognition", which was
# sponsored by Samsung.
